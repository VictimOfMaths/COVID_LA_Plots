# COVID_LA_Plots
Code for Shiny app to explore Local Authority COVID-19 data in the UK: https://victimofmaths.shinyapps.io/COVID_LA_Plots/
<br><br>
Much credit is due [@lukejostins](https://twitter.com/lukejostins) to who took a previous version of my messy code and turned it into [the first version of this app](https://victimofshiny.shinyapps.io/shiny/).<br><br>
[server.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID_LA_Plots/blob/master/server.R) and [ui.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID_LA_Plots/blob/master/ui.R) contain the actual code for the app, while [UnderlyingCode.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID_LA_Plots/blob/master/UnderlyingCode.R) is the code that generates the various .csv files.

The app produces 10 different sets of plots for England, Northern Ireland Scotland, Wales and every Lower Tier Local Authority/Council Area although not all plots are available for all countries.<br><br>
